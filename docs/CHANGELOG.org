To python plugin developers:
- write plugin in python is more like a preview feature, not all launchy interface is ported to python, and I will keep working on this part to provide a better and more comprehensive support.
- I rarely develop in python, and I just learned the basics of python, so I need suggestions and advices about python. If you have any idea or I did something wrong, go ahead and post an issue.
- If you need extra lanchy interface exposed to python, post an issue.
